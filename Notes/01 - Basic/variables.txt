Variables Notes
Hello!

In the Next Lecture I will be copy pasting this code into the "Main" method in my Visual Studio Code window to streamline the process of covering these different variable types and supply some of the notes and specific numbers that are related to different variable types in C#.

The Script below can be copied into your Visual Studio Code project's "Main" method, or you can type it out as we cover each type, whichever you prefer.



A lot of what we cover in the next lecture is more to give you a reference point, and less something that you need to memorize, so don't worry too much about taking notes, the goal is just to understand the basic idea of the data types we will talk about.



            //// 1 byte is made up of 8 bits 00000000 - these bits can be used to store a number as follows
            // //// Each bit can be worth 0 or 1 of the value it is placed in
            // ////// From the right we start with a value of 1 and double for each digit to the left
            // //// 00000000 = 0
            // //// 00000001 = 1
            // //// 00000010 = 2
            // //// 00000011 = 3
            // //// 00000100 = 4
            // //// 00000101 = 5
            // //// 00000110 = 6
            // //// 00000111 = 7
            // //// 00001000 = 8

            double myDouble = 0.751;
            double mySecondDouble = 0.75d;
 
            // 16 byte (128 bit) floating point number
            decimal myDecimal = 0.751m;
            decimal mySecondDecimal = 0.75m;
 
            // Console.WriteLine(myFloat - mySecondFloat);
            // Console.WriteLine(myDouble - mySecondDouble);

            string myString = "Hello World";
            // Console.WriteLine(myString);
