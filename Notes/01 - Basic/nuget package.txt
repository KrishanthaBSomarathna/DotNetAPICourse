Nuget package source and C# extensions in VS Code
Hello!

In the next lecture we will make sure that we are all connected to a nuget package source, and get a few extensions installed in VS Code to make sure that intellisense in VS Code will work for you throughout the course.



First we will check if we already have a nuget source with the following command:
dotnet nuget list source

Next we will attempt to add the nuget.org source with the following command:
dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org

For the add source command I will be copying it from the text above, and I suggest that you do the same to avoid typos and save yourself some time.



Finally we will open VS Code and install the following extensions

C#

C# Dev Kit



See you in the next lecture!
